### (tronline-test)
2-player "Online" Tron Game
A test in making java client/server applications

## Summary
This project isn't intended to be anything new; I'm only working with it to practice and gain experience using Java Sockets dynamically, in this case the server needs to create the connection with two separate clients, and then run the game while continuously receiving keypresses and sending feedback to both clients.

## Current State
Base 'TRON' frame is complete, have not started working with a server or sockets yet, although the game is completely playable with two players on one computer using arrow keys and WASD. Dynamic socket code is ready, but still needs to be integrated with the game (into a server/client).
